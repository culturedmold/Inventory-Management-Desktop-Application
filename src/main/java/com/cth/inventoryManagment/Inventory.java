 * Inventory class contains all parts and products in inventory, as well as methods to get parts, get products, update/delete parts or products, and search parts or products
 * This class provides static data that persists through our application.
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENT: Storing inventory data in a database would allow the application to have actual utility. By only storing the data in memory, we have to add the inventory manually each time we open the application.

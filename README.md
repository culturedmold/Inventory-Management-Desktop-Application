## Overview
This project was primarily an exercise in Object Oriented Programming principles. The program makes extensive use of and demonstrates compentency in class abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. The program also demonstrates compentency in exception handling, MVC architecture, basic data structures, and UX/UI design. Extensive documentation has also been provided in the form of Javadoc files.

## Future Enhancements
Because the application is not making any calls to a database to retrieve, store, or alter data, the data is stored in memory and has to be re-entered each time the application opens. The logical extension of this program would be to connect to a database to persist data.
